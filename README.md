# Audio-YouTube-Video-Transcription-and-Sentiment-Analysis
This program can transcribe audio/YouTube videos into English. It can also perform sentiment analysis on the video, along with being able to convert YouTube videos into audio files.

The data folder has contents from when I ran the code with a YouTube video. (The specific run data was removed from main)
The main.py as it is does not have the YouTube video embedded within it and it does not have the JSON file within it.
